    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: April 27, 2024</p>

    <h2>1. Commitment to Quality</h2>
    <p>
        At SignalNet, we are dedicated to providing high-quality trading signals to enhance your trading strategies. We offer a refund policy under specific conditions outlined below. Please read this policy carefully to understand your rights and obligations.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility Criteria for Refunds</h2>
    <h3>2.1. Strict Adherence to Trading Signals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide verifiable, unaltered screenshots demonstrating full compliance with each trading signal as issued by SignalNet.</li>
        <li>All trades must be executed exclusively on the MEXC exchange with a minimum capital investment of $1,000 and must not exceed a leverage ratio of 2x.</li>
        <li>Submit a detailed and timestamped trading log covering a continuous period of 30 days, adhering strictly to our specified trading protocols.</li>
        <li>Maintain consistent trading activity without significant deviations from the recommended strategies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2. Comprehensive Verification Process</h3>
    <p>
        Upon receiving your refund request, our dedicated team will undertake an exhaustive review of your trading activities over the 60-day subscription period. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cross-referencing trade execution times and prices against the provided signals.</li>
        <li>Verifying adherence to leverage restrictions and capital investment requirements.</li>
        <li>Assessing the integrity and completeness of the submitted trading logs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Any inconsistencies, deviations, or evidence of non-compliance will result in the immediate denial of your refund request.
    </p>

    <h3>2.3. Performance Assessment Parameters</h3>
    <p>
        To qualify for a refund, your account must exhibit a performance indicator of zero or negative returns despite strict compliance with all provided signals. The assessment will consider:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Overall profitability during the subscription period.</li>
        <li>Consistency in following trading signals without unauthorized modifications.</li>
        <li>Impact of external market factors beyond SignalNet's control.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If the performance metrics align with your refund claim, a full refund will be processed along with an additional 20 trading signals to enhance your future trading strategies. Should there be discrepancies between your performance and the refund claim, SignalNet reserves the right to offer a partial refund of up to 50% or deny the request entirely based on the evaluation.
    </p>

    <h3>2.4. Mandatory Trading Commitment</h3>
    <p>
        Eligibility for a refund requires active and consistent trading using SignalNet's signals for a minimum of 30 days within the initial 60-day subscription period. Irregular trading behavior, such as sporadic adherence or ignoring multiple signals, will render the refund request ineligible.
